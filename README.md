# My first express project
It's a simple application where users can send "money" between each other
### the app supports:
- registering users (with username uniqueness)
- authentication (users and admin privileges)
- commit transactions between users (if they have the balance (or they are admin :) ))
- check own transaction history
- admin panel to overview whats happening ( everyone's balance and all of the transactions)

The backend is an express rest server.
Frontend is plain html + js + bootstrap
